# Testing-grounds
Too advanced for today's me(6/26/25 10:30)

Hi! I'm Franz, this is my first github "project" ig(?), newbie at coding, and in 2 months from now I will be a 2nd year college student in BISU. In this folder lies the output of my tested product that "I" recently made which is a personal llm chatbot that can assist you(well this is more of like for myself since I really wanted something similar to neuro-sama). I will try my best to finish this.
